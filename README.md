This is a highly scalable web application leveraging several AWS tools to achieve near-zero lags.
1. Run node index from socket folder
2. run readQueue.py from main folder
3. run application.py using python3 from main folder
The application is now hosted on port 5500, make a note of this.
The front end now should show live processing of tweets
4. Quit the readQueue.py quickly otherwise the queue will get emptied and there will be no notifications anymore.
